This plugin provides spin-button interface easily on your form.
This kind of interface is very handy to set especially short or middle range numbers.

Requirements:
	Button surface image.

Usage:
	$(':input').spin(opt);

Options:
  imageBasePath:
    In most cases, this option would be mandatory.
    You need to specify your spin-button surface images.
    When all your spin-related-images are on a same directory(I hope so), you can set
    your image path onto this parameter.
    default value is "/img/spin/".
    You don't have to specify this option in case your environment were luckyly like this :)

  spinBtnImage/spinUpImage/spinDownImage:
    The names of spin button images.
    default value is "spin-button.png", "spin-up.png" and "spin-down.png".
    (these sample files are included in img directory in the download file.
     but needless to say you can use your own images!)

  interval:
    Add/subtract this value from current value, when users click spin button.
    default value is 1.

  max/min:
    The maximum/minimum value. Null means unlimited.

  timeInterval:
    While users keep pressing mouse button on the spin-button, the value will be increasing.
    This value is the time interval of increasing.
    default value is 500(milli seconds)

  timeBlink:
    The time interval of blinking the spin button when increasing/decreasing the value.
    default value is 200(milli seconds)

  btnClass:
    Specify your own class for button image.

  btnCss:
    Specify your own styles as javascript object for button image.

  txtCss:
    Specify your own styles as javascript object for input field.

  lock:
    Prohibit direct input to text field.
    Please don't expect perfect.

  decimal:
    Set decimal character in case you don't want to use '.'.
    eg. decimal: ','

  beforeChange:
    Callback before value is changing.
    When you return "false", the changing would not happen.
    First argument is the new value, and second one is the current value.

  changed:
    Callback after value has changed.
    First argument is the value.

  buttonUp/buttonDown:
    Callback when up/down button has clicked.
    This function is called whether the value has changed.

Note:
  If you want to change the values of default option, you can set your own default value
  onto $.spin object.
  eg. $.spin.imageBasePath = '/images/spin/';

Demo:
	Try out demonstrations under "demo" directory.
